# /dev/null

## Introduction

/dev/null makes your life in WoW more pleasant by ignoring various chat annoyances.

When you enter a capital city:
	It will ignore people who /yell.
	It will ignore spammy NPCs (ie. Ironforge bread vendor, Topper McNab in Stormwind etc).
	It will ignore duel spam (A has defeated B in a duel).
	It will ignore emotes except those directed at yourself.
	It will ignore drunk spam (X looks tipsy).
	It will ignore tradeskill spam.

When you enter an instance or battleground:
	It will mute the general channel.

All features can be toggled with the slash command /devnull or /dn
