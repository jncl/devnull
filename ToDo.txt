		- When you enter a raid, you often see this:
			Player1 has joined the raid.
			Player2 has joined the raid.
			Player3 has joined the raid.
			Player4 has joined the raid.
			Player5 has joined the raid.
		  I'd like to see:
			Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 have joined the raid.

		- Same thing really with achievements. I dont want all of them filtered from my party or guild chat. That makes it really confusing when someone in guild says "grats" to someone and I have no idea why. I just want them grped. Instead of seeing lines and lines of names like with joining/leaving a raid, I'd like to just see one message listing everyone who got the achievement.
		- HOWEVER, I would like the random achievements of people standing next to me in the AH or the mailbox to be filtered. If they're not in my guild or in my party I don't need to know that they have a plethora of pets.

		- Also, I dont need to see everyone in my raid or party looting their Emblems of Frost. I only want to see that I got mine, and I dont care about their spam. I don't need to see their Stone Keeper's Shards or Emblems of Triumph or Crusader Mark or Badge of Justice.
