		- When you enter a raid, you often see this:
			Player1 has joined the raid.
			Player2 has joined the raid.
			Player3 has joined the raid.
			Player4 has joined the raid.
			Player5 has joined the raid.
		  I'd like to see:
			Player1, Player2, Player3, Player4, Player5 have joined the raid.

		- Same thing really with achievements. I dont want all of them filtered from my party or guild chat. That makes it really confusing when someone in guild says "grats" to someone and I have no idea why. I just want them grped. Instead of seeing lines and lines of names like with joining/leaving a raid, I'd like to just see one message listing everyone who got the achievement.
		- HOWEVER, I would like the random achievements of people standing next to me in the AH or the mailbox to be filtered. If they're not in my guild or in my party I don't need to know that they have a plethora of pets.

		- Also, I dont need to see everyone in my raid or party looting their Emblems of Frost. I only want to see that I got mine, and I dont care about their spam. I don't need to see their Stone Keeper's Shards or Emblems of Triumph or Crusader Mark or Badge of Justice.

		--> I think a lot of this is now done automatically, don't raid enough to test this properly.

		- If I leave the mob/NPC yells active (not muted) in the General tab, the addon keeps turning on Yells for EVERY chat frame, not just the main chat one, so I'm spammed with them even where they should not appear (like other addons frames, ie HitsMode5).
